##    What is JavaScript? 
<hr/>
JavaScript is a high-level programming language that has become an essential tool for building interactive and dynamic web pages.<br/>
It was created to provide web developers with a way to add interactivity and functionality to static HTML pages, making them more engaging and responsive to user actions. <br/>
JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means that it runs on the user's web browser rather than the server. It is also an interpreted language, which means that it does not require a compilation step and can be executed directly as plain text.<br/>
JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. <br/>
Client-side development:

* Form validation,DOM manipulation,User interface interactions
* Client-side frameworks e.g React, Angular, Vue.js so many others.

Server-side development:

* Web server programming,Database interactions,APIs
* Server-side frameworks e.g Node.js, Express, NestJS so many others.

##    When and why was JavaScript created? 
<hr/>

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in just 10 days in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. <br/>
The language was initially called Mocha, then changed to LiveScript, before finally settling on JavaScript. <br/>
The primary goal of creating JavaScript was to enable web developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages. JavaScript quickly became popular because it allowed web pages to respond to user actions without requiring a server request, which greatly improved the user experience.


##    Why is it called JavaScript? 
<hr/>

Initially, JavaScript was called LiveScript, but its name was changed to JavaScript to take advantage of the popularity of Java programming language at that time. However, despite its name, JavaScript has little in common with Java beyond some syntax similarities. JavaScript has since evolved into its own language, with its own specification called ECMAScript. Today, it is a widely used programming language that is essential for building modern web applications.


##    JavaScript engines and their role in executing JavaScript code on various devices
<hr/>

JavaScript can now be executed not only in the browser but also on various devices with the help of a JavaScript engine. <br/>
 A JavaScript engine is a program that interprets JavaScript code and converts it into machine code that can be executed by the device's processor. Different engines have different codenames such as:

* V8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
* SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.
* Chakra – in Internet Explorer.
* JavaScriptCore – in Safari.

## How do engines work?
<hr/>
Engines are complicated. But the basics are easy. <br/>
A summary of how JavaScript engines work.  <br/>

* The engine (embedded if it’s a browser) reads (“parses”) the script.
* Then it converts (“compiles”) the script imto machine code.
* And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.

The engine applies optimizations at each step of the process. It even watches the compiled script as it runs, analyzes the data that flows through it, and further optimizes the machine code based on that knowledge.

##  Javascript is both imperative and declarative type of language.
<hr/>

JavaScript is both imperative and declarative because it allows you to write code that follows both paradigms. For example, you can use imperative code to iterate through an array of items and perform a set of operations on each item. At the same time, you can use declarative code to define the structure of a web page using HTML or the style of a web page using CSS. <br/>

In programming languages, imperative and declarative are two different programming paradigms.
<br>
<b>Imperative language</b>

* Imperative programming is a style of programming that focuses on describing how to perform a certain task. It involves a sequence of statements that update the state of the program. In an imperative language, you tell the computer what to do, step by step.

<b>Declarative language</b>

* Declarative programming, on the other hand, focuses on describing what a program should accomplish, without specifying how to accomplish it. Instead of giving the computer a set of instructions to follow, you define a set of constraints or rules that the program should follow.

## What makes JavaScript unique?

There are at least three great things:
1. Full integration with HTML/CSS.
2. Simple tasks can be accomplished easily.
3. Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default.
